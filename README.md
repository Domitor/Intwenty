# Intwenty
A meta data based web application platform, a tool for developers

1. Let the user describe applications by inputing meta data
2. Generate database and database objects based on meta data
3. Generate UI and UI components based on meta data
4. Generate standard logic such as user input validation based on meta data
5. Based on meta data, generate standard logic for I/O operations against the database 
6. Let the user focus on the fun and fancy parts of development and let Intwenty handle the rest
