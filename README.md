# Intwenty
Is a meta data driven Template that simplifies developing CMS, Blog Engines and other systems. Intwenty is built on Vue.js and ASP.NET Core.

- It lets you create meta models that describes UI and data.
- Models are stored as data instead of strongly typed objects.
- It uses the model to create the database, render UI and make you happier.
- Applications (models) are easily localized and may be defined either programaticly or visually with included designers.
- Implements and extends Asp.Net Core Identity. Intwenty adds organization and product management.
- Has built in support for tenant isolation
- Uses Intwenty.DataClient (Instead of entity framework) a small but fast Db connection library with ORM functions and JSON support
- The Nuget version is an RCL Package (Razor Class Library) that includes both UI and Controllers to get you up and running fast.
- Is constantly improved (and changing)
