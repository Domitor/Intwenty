Last year, it came to light that six algorithms used on an estimated 60-100 million patients nationwide were prioritizing care coordination for white patients over black patients for the same level of illness.\n\nThe reason? The algorithm was trained on costs in insurance claims data, predicting which patients would be expensive in the future based on who was expensive in the past. Historically, less is spent on black patients than white patients, so the algorithm ended up perpetuating existing bias in healthcare.\n\nTherein lies the danger of using narrow datasets in Artificial Intelligence: If the data is biased, the AI will be biased. That doesn\u0027t mean we should (or, now that the genie is out of the bottle, can) abandon AI. Which leads to an obvious question: Can using broader datasets, including socioeconomic data, reduce the influence of bias in clinical AI and correct systemic bias that persists in vital institutions like healthcare, education, and law enforcement?","ArticleImage":"/USERDOC/637399282008509833_viskabergsbron_2018.jpg"}, "blog_ArticleComments": []}},{"ApplicationId":50,"AppMetaCode":"BLOGAPP","DbName":"blog_Blog","Id":32,"Version":1,"ApplicationData":{"blog_Blog":{ "MetaCode":"BLOGAPP","PerformDate":"2021-06-22","StartDate":"2021-06-22","EndDate":"2021-06-22","Id":32,"Version":1,"ApplicationId":50,"CreatedBy":"admin@intwenty.dev","ChangedBy":"admin@intwenty.dev","OwnedBy":"admin@intwenty.dev","OwnedByOrganizationId":"1","OwnedByOrganizationName":"Default Org","ChangedDate":"2021-06-22","ArticleHeader":"SpaceX\u0027s Starlink","ArticleText":"SpaceX\u0027s Starlink internet public beta \u2013 dubbed the \u0027Better Than Nothing Beta\u0027 test \u2013 kicked off last week and the first results are starting to roll in. \n\nThe Starlink service currently costs $99 a month with a $499 startup fee for the user terminal, a tripod and Wi-Fi router. \n\nNETWORKING\nHow to find the best VPN service: Your guide to staying safe on the internet\nZoom vs Skype: Microsoft pushes its Meet Now feature for \u0027hassle-free\u0027 video calls\nWhat is 5G?
